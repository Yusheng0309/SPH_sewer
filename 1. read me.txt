Smoothed Particle Hydyodynamics (SPH) is a kind of numerical simulation method.

It is meshless and uses moving particles as the computationl nodes.

This project is trying to construct a one dimensional sewer model by solving the partial differential equations.

The PDEs  include the continuity equation and shallow water equation. 

This project can simulate the fluid flowing in the sewer and obtatins the velocites and pressures accurately.

The test case is from the paper of V. Casulli and G.S. Stelling (2013) "A semi-implicit numerical model for urban drainage system."

This case is a steady pipe flow problem that includes both free surface and pressurized flow with a hydraulic jump. The pipe consists of three 
parts: a horizontal pipe of length 2 m, a downward inclined pip at an angle -10 degree having length 4 m, and a horizontal pipe of length 2 m.
The pipes have a circulaar cross section with an inner diameter of 0.22 m.
